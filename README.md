The Display Panel (DP) is a tool for convenient and ultra-fast visualization of two-dimensional datasets.

It was originally developed by Dr. Edgar Abarca Morales as a graphical interface for visualizing ARPES spectroscopy data. The DP was later incorporated into the PyPhoto software and subsequently adapted and embedded into the peaks software developed by King’s group at the University of St Andrews (UK):

The version distributed here is a general implementation of the two-dimensional DP, suitable for visualizing a wide range of data types, including images, spectroscopic measurements, and scalar fields.
